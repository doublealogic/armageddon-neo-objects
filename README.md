# Armageddon? Near Earth Orbit Objects and Space Junk
Using existing NASA data and Space-Track.org, we will analyze the phenomenon of Near Earth Orbit (NEO) objects to glean an understanding of the frequency with which the Earth encounters danger from space.

Project Description: Using existing NASA data and Space-Track.org, we will analyze the
phenomenon of Near Earth Orbit (NEO) objects to glean an understanding of the frequency
with which the Earth encounters danger from space.
Questions for consideration:

- an item
- another item
    - a nested item
    
    
1. item 1
    1. something else
    1. something else
    1. item under item 1
1. item 2

1. Based on the following parameters: objects 100 m or greater in size whose approach to Earth are within one Lunar Distance unit (384,402 km):
    1. Between 1900-2020, how many NEOs have presented a legitimate threat to life on Earth? 
    1. From 2020-2200, how many NEOs are being tracked that pose a potential threat to life on Earth?
1. Since the advent of human space exploration, "space junk" has been accumulating
around the Earth. With this in mind?
   1. alternative hypothesis: If countries with the highest gdp produce the most space trash then wealthier economies correlate with space trash    production.
   1. null hypothesis: If countries with the highest gdp do not produce the most space trash then wealthier economies correlate with space trash    production.
   1. Is there a correlation between higher GDP and a greater amount of junk released into space?
   1. Has the amount of space junk increased or decreased since the conclusion of the Space Race (circa: 1975)?
Datasets to be utilized:
NEO Earth Close Approaches (NASA): https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/ca/
Space-Track.org: www.space-track.org
Breakdown by Task:
1. Determine, through reputable scientific sources, the parameters (size of object, distance
from Earth) that determine potentially globally catastrophic events.
2. Gather the appropriate data from the NEO NASA database â€“ (may not necessitate API
pull).
3. Clean data from NEO NASA database and compile data frames

4. Compile data from SpaceTrack database to determine:
  * a. Which nations put the most pieces of space junk into space (bar graph?)
  * b. How has the amount of space junk increased/decreased over the last six decades (line graph)
