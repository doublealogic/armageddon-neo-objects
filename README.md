Project Description: Using existing NASA data and Space-Track.org, we will analyze the
phenomenon of Near Earth Orbit (NEO) objects to glean an understanding of the frequency
with which the Earth encounters danger from space.
Questions for consideration:
1. Based on scientifically accepted standards object size and proximity of encounter to
Earth:
a. Over the last 120 years, how many NEO encounters presented the potential for a
regional catastrophe? What were the top 25 such events?
b. Over the same period, how many NEO encounters presented the potential for a
global catastrophe
c. Looking forward, between 2021 and 2200, what 25 events present the best
potential for a globally catastrophic event?

2. Since the advent of human space exploration, “space junk” has been accumulating
around the Earth. With this in mind?
a. How often does manmade space junk present a danger to Earth? The
international space station?

Datasets to be utilized:
NEO Earth Close Approaches (NASA): https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/ca/
Space-Track.org: www.space-track.org
Rough Breakdown by Task:
Candy: Working on data related to how much space junk has been released in space since the
advent of space travel– SpaceTrack
Kevin: Gathering/cleaning/etc. – NASA NEOs 1900-2020, document writing lead
Kirk: Working on data related to how often space junk presents a danger to Earth? International
Space Station? – SpaceTrack
Aaron: Gathering/cleaning/etc. – NASA NEOs 2021 - 2200, presentation lead.
