Project Description: Using existing NASA data and Space-Track.org, we will analyze the
phenomenon of Near Earth Orbit (NEO) objects to glean an understanding of the frequency
with which the Earth encounters danger from space.
Questions for consideration:
1. Based on scientifically accepted standards object size and proximity of encounter to
Earth:
a. Over the last 120 years, how many NEO encounters presented the potential for a
regional catastrophe? What were the top 25 such events?
b. Over the same period, how many NEO encounters presented the potential for a
global catastrophe
c. Looking forward, between 2021 and 2200, what 25 events present the best
potential for a globally catastrophic event?

2. Since the advent of human space exploration, “space junk” has been accumulating
around the Earth. With this in mind?
a. How often does manmade space junk present a danger to Earth? The
international space station?

Datasets to be utilized:
NEO Earth Close Approaches (NASA): https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/ca/
Space-Track.org: www.space-track.org
Rough Breakdown by Task:
1. Determine, through reputable scientific sources, the parameters (size of object, distance
from Earth) that determine potentially globally catastrophic events.
2. Gather the appropriate data from the NEO NASA database – (may not necessitate API
pull).
3. Clean data from NEO NASA database and compile data frames for:
a. 25 globally catastrophic “closest calls” with NEO since 1900
b. 25 future potentially globally catastrophic events with NEO 2021-2200
4. Analyze NEO that have impacted Earth and create a bar graph illustrating which
continents have been suffered the most collisions.
5. Compile data from SpaceTrack database to determine:
a. Which nations put the most pieces of space junk into space (bar graph?)

b. How has the amount of space junk increased/decreased over the last six decades
(line graph)
c. Break down of large, medium and small objects (pie chart)
d. Object types: rocket, payload, debris, unknown etc. (bar graph or pie chart)
